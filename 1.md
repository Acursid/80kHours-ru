Part 1:

What makes for a dream job? Here&#039;s what the evidence says.

# We reviewed over 60 studies about what makes for a dream job. Here&#8217;s what we&nbsp;found.

By <span class="byline author vcard"><a href="https://80000hours.org/author/benjamin-todd/" rel="author" class="fn">Benjamin Todd</a></span> &middot; Last updated <time class="update" datetime="2017-04-07T00:00:00+00:00">April 2017</time>

We all want to find a dream job that’s enjoyable and meaningful, but what does that actually mean?

Some people imagine that the answer involves discovering their *passion* through a flash of insight, while others think that the key elements of their dream job are that it be easy and highly paid.

We’ve reviewed two decades of research into the causes of a satisfying life and career, drawing on over 60 studies, and we didn’t find much evidence for these views.

Instead, we found six key ingredients of a dream job. They don’t include income, and they aren’t as simple as “following your passion”.

In fact, following your passion can lead you astray. Steve Jobs was passionate about Zen Buddhism before entering technology. Condoleezza Rice was a talented classical musician before she started studying politics.

Rather, you can develop passion by doing work that you find enjoyable and meaningful. The key is to get good at something that helps other people.

## Where we go wrong

The usual way people try to work out their dream job is to *imagine* different jobs and think about how satisfying they seem. Or they think about times they’ve felt fulfilled in the past and self-reflect about what matters most to them.

![](https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/xkcd-dream-job.png)[`<a href="https://xkcd.com/1346/" target="_blank"><center>xkcd</center></a>`]

If this were a normal career guide, we’d start by getting you to write out a list of what you most want from a job, like “working outdoors” and “working with ambitious people”. The best-selling career advice book of all time, *What Color is Your Parachute*, recommends exactly this. The hope is that, deep down, people know what they really want.

However, research shows that although self-reflection is useful, it only goes so far.

You can probably think of times in your own life when you were excited about a holiday or party, but when it actually happened, it was just okay. In the last few decades, research has shown that this is common: we’re bad at predicting what will make us most happy, and we don’t even realise how bad we are. You can find an excellent overview of this research in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427" target="_blank"> *Stumbling on Happiness*</a>, by Harvard Professor Dan Gilbert.[^:`There has been an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting">extensive programme</a> of research into how good humans are at predicting the effects of future events on their emotional well-being. It began with Kahneman and Snell in the early 1990s, and has recently been led by Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert. Much of the research is summarised in Gilbert’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427">Stumbling on Happiness</a>. A recent review is in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170403154011/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3110936/Gilbert_WhyBrainTalksItself.pdf?sequence=1">Gilbert and Wilson (2009)</a>. The main takeaway is that we are bad at predicting how we will feel in the future, and we don’t realise this. We’ve previously written about our failures to predict how we will feel <a href="/2012/09/do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy/">here</a>.`]

It turns out we’re even bad at *remembering* how satisfying different experiences were. One well-established mistake is that we tend to judge an experience mainly by its ending. If you missed your flight on the last day of an enjoyable holiday, you’ll probably remember the holiday as bad. This means we can’t just trust our intuitions; we need a more systematic way of working out which job is best for us.

> The fact that we often judge the pleasure of an experience by its ending can cause us to make some curious choices.<br />
– Prof. Dan Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness

The same research that proves how bad we are at self-reflection can help us make more informed choices. We now have two decades of research into positive psychology – the science of happiness – as well as decades of research into motivation and job satisfaction. We’ll summarise the main lessons of this research and explain what it means for finding a fulfilling job.

## Two overrated goals for a fulfilling career

People often imagine that a dream job is well paid and easy.

One of the leading job rankings in the US, provided by Careercast, rates jobs on the following criteria:[^:`CareerCast’s 2015 methodology is described <a href="http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2015-jobs-rated-methodology">here</a>. <br> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302120256/http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2015-jobs-rated-methodology">Archived link</a>, retrieved 2-March-2016`]

1. Is it highly paid?
1. Is it going to be highly paid in the future?
1. Is it stressful?
1. Is the working environment unpleasant?

Based on this, the best job in 2015 was: actuary.[^:`<a href="http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2015">Actuary was the top ranked career in 2015.</a> <br> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302120647/http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2015">Archived link</a>, retrieved 2-Mar-2016.`] That is, someone who uses statistics to measure and manage risks, often in the insurance industry.

It’s true that actuaries are more satisfied with their jobs than average, but they’re not among the most satisfied.[^:`A national survey by the UK’s Cabinet Office in 2014 (published by the University of Kent) found actuaries ranked 64th out of 274 job titles, putting them in the top 23%. <br> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">BBC summary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416020107/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">Archived link</a>, retrieved 15-April-2017. <br> <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm">http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm</a>`] Only 36% say their work is meaningful,[^:`A national survey by the UK’s Cabinet Office in 2014 (published by the University of Kent) found actuaries ranked 64th out of 274 job titles, putting them in the top 23%. <br> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">BBC summary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416020107/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">Archived link</a>, retrieved 15-April-2017. <br> <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm">http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm</a>`] so being an actuary isn’t a particularly fulfilling career.

So the *Careercast* list isn’t capturing everything. In fact, the evidence suggests that money and avoiding stress aren’t that important.

### Money makes you happier, but only a little

It’s a cliche that “you can’t buy happiness”, but at the same time, financial security is among most people’s <a href="https://www.netimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/what-workers-want-2012.pdf" target="_blank">top career priorities</a>[^:` Net Impact, What Workers Want in 2012 <br> See Figure 1.1 <br> <a href="https://www.netimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/what-workers-want-2012.pdf">https://www.netimpact.org/sites/default/files/documents/what-workers-want-2012.pdf</a>`]. Moreover, when people are asked what would most improve the quality of their lives, the most common answer is more money.
[^:`|When individuals are asked what would most improve the quality of their lives, the most common response is a higher income</blockquote> Judge, Timothy A., et al. "The relationship between pay and job satisfaction: A meta-analysis of the literature." Journal of Vocational Behavior 77.2 (2010): 157-167. <br> <a href="http://www.panglossinc.com/documents/Therelationshipbetweenpayandjobsatisfaction.pdf">http://www.panglossinc.com/documents/Therelationshipbetweenpayandjobsatisfaction.pdf</a>`] What’s going on here? Which side is right?

A lot of the research on this question is remarkably low quality. But several recent major studies in economics offer more clarity. We <a href="/articles/money-and-happiness/">reviewed the best studies available</a>, and the truth turns out to lie in the middle: money *does* make you happy, but only a little.

Here are the findings from a huge survey in the United States in 2010:

![Money and happiness survey](https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/80K_incomewellnessA_V6-1024x543.png)[` *High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being*, D. Kahneman and A. Deaton, 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full" target="_blank">link</a>`]

People were asked to rate how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale from one to ten. The result is shown on the right, while the bottom shows their household income.

You can see that going from a (pre-tax) income of $40,000 to $80,000 is only associated with an increase in life satisfaction from about 6.5 to 7 out of 10. That’s a *lot* of extra income for a small increase.

But that’s optimistic. If we look at day-to-day happiness, income is even less important. “Positive affect” is whether people reported feeling happy yesterday. The left shows the fraction of people who said “yes”. This line goes flat around $50,000, showing that beyond this point income had no relationship with day-to-day happiness.

![Money and happiness survey](https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/80K_incomewellnessB_V6-1024x543.png)[` *High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being*, D. Kahneman and A. Deaton, 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full" target="_blank">link</a>`]

The picture is similar if we look at the fraction who were “not blue” or “stress free” yesterday.

![Money and happiness survey](https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/80K_incomewellnessC_V6-1024x543.png)[` *High income improves evaluation of life but not emotional well-being*, D. Kahneman and A. Deaton, 2010, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http://www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full" target="_blank">link</a>`]

These lines are completely flat by $75,000, so beyond this point, income had *no* relationship with how happy, sad or stressed people felt. This is hardly surprising – we all know people who’ve gone into high earning jobs and ended up miserable.

Moreover, the relationship between income and happiness under this threshold may be caused by a third factor. For example, being healthy could both make you happier and allow you to earn more. If this is true, then the effect of earning extra money will be even weaker than the correlations above suggest.

Finally, $75,000 of household income is equivalent to an *individual* income of only $40,000 if you don’t have kids.[^:`The average household in the US has 2.5 people, but of course this is just an average across a wide range of family structures. Larger households enjoy ‘economies of scale’ by sharing houses, cars, and so on. This makes it tricky to say what the equivalent of a household income is for a single individual.</p>
Standard conversion rates are the following:</p>
<li>A single individual has an equivalence score of 1.</li>
<li>A single extra adult adds another equivalence score of 0.5.</li>
<li>Adding a young child to this adds an equivalence score of 0.3, while a teenager costs another 0.5.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result a couple can achieve the same lifestyle as an individual with 50% more income; a couple with a young child can achieve the same lifestyle as an individual with 80% more income; a couple with a teenager require an income twice as high.</p>
<p>These are approximations, but reasonable ones used by international organisations. They are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302122348/http://www.ifs.org.uk/wheredoyoufitin/about.php">described here by the UK Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity we will assume that on average across their adult lives people are in a household with an adult couple and half a child. This is just an average - some people will be single, while some will be supporting multiple children, at least for some of their lives.</p>
<p>Using this approximation means that a single individual requires about 1/1.9 = 53% as much as a typical household, averaged over their adult lives, to achieve the same standard of living.</p>
<p>In this case, 53% of $50,000-$75,000 for a household represents $27,000-$40,000 for an individual.</p>`]

To customise this threshold for yourself, make the following adjustments (all pre-tax):

. The $40,000 figure was for 2009. Due to inflation, it’s more like $45,000 in 2016.
. Add $20,000 per dependent who does not work that you fully support.
. Add 50% if you live in an expensive city (e.g. NY, SF), or subtract 30% if you live somewhere cheap (e.g. rural Tennessee). You can find cost of living calculations online, like this one.
. Add more if you’re especially motivated by money (or subtract some if you have frugal tastes).
. Add 15% in order to be able to save for retirement (or however much you personally need to save in order to be able to maintain the standard of living described above).

The average college graduate in the United States has recently earned about $77,000 per year over his or her working life, while the average Ivy League graduate earns over $110,000.[^:`<p><strong>College grad earnings</strong></p>
<p>Source:<br />
<br />
Carnevale, Anthony P., Stephen J. Rose, and Ban Cheah. "The college payoff: Education, occupations, lifetime earnings." (2011).<br />
<a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/collegepayoff-complete.pdf">https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/collegepayoff-complete.pdf</a></p>
<p>Working:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 "the mean (average) earnings of those with a Bachelor’s degree is $500,000 higher than the median ($2.7 million)"
</p></blockquote>
<p>They are using a 40 year career to calculate working income:</p>
<blockquote><p>
 "Overall, the median lifetime earnings for all workers are $1.7 million, which is just under $42,000 per year ($20 per hour). Over a 40-year career, those who didn’t earn a high school diploma or GED are expected to bring in less than $1 million, which translates into slightly more than $24,000 a year ($11.70 per hour)."
</p></blockquote>
<p>So 2.7 million / 40 = $67,500</p>
<p>This figure was for 2011, but wages have grown since then. In Jan 2011, average wages per hour in the US were $22.85 and were $26 in Jan 2017. That’s growth of 14%, which suggests that the average college graduate now earns $77,000. This is likely an underestimate, because college graduate earnings have been growing faster than average earnings. Source: <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003">FRED Economic Data</a>, “Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees: Total Private (CES0500000003)”, retrieved 5-Feb-2017. This growth matches inflation, which was also <a href="http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states.aspx">about 14% over the period</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mean earnings for US Ivy League grads</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to find comparable data for just Ivy League grads. Payscale found a median mid-career salary of over $104,000, where mid-career is defined as over 10 years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-type/bachelors/ivy-league-schools#fullText">Source</a>, retrieved 12 Feb 2016.</p>
<p>Our guess is that the Payscale data is too high, because people with higher incomes will be more likely to fill out the survey. On the other hand, income only peaks after 20-30 years, so the figure for 10+ years probably under-reports the overall average. Moreover, the median will be less than the mean.</p>
<p>Overall, we’re pretty confident that the mean lifetime average for Ivy League students is over $100,000, but we’re still looking for better data.</p>
<p>If you want to estimate your future income, then you should also account for future wage growth (which has been about 2% historically). We ignore this here, and only estimate current income.</p>`] The upshot is that if you’re a college graduate in the US (or a similar country), then you’ll likely end up well into the range where more income has almost no effect on your happiness.

### Don’t aim for low stress

Many people tell us they want to “find a job that’s not too stressful.” And it’s true that in the past, doctors and psychologists believed that stress was always bad. However, we <a href="/2016/02/should-you-look-for-a-low-stress-job/">did a survey of the modern literature on stress</a>, and today, the picture is a bit more complicated.

One puzzle is that studies of high ranking government and military leaders found they had *lower* levels of stress hormones and less anxiety, despite sleeping fewer hours, managing more people and having higher occupational demands.

One widely supported explanation is that having a greater sense of control (by setting their own schedules and determining how to tackle the challenges they face) protects them against the demands of the position.

There are other ways that a demanding job can be good or bad depending on context:
