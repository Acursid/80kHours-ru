Part 1:
What makes for a dream job? Here&#039;s what the evidence says.
# We reviewed over 60 studies about what makes for a dream job. Here&#8217;s what we&nbsp;found.

We all want to find a dream job that’s enjoyable and meaningful, but what does that actually mean?
Some people imagine that the answer involves discovering their passion through a flash of insight, while others think that the key elements of their dream job are that it be easy and highly paid.
We’ve reviewed two decades of research into the causes of a satisfying life and career, drawing on over 60 studies, and we didn’t find much evidence for these views.
Instead, we found six key ingredients of a dream job. They don’t include income, and they aren’t as simple as “following your passion”.
In fact, following your passion can lead you astray. Steve Jobs was passionate about Zen Buddhism before entering technology. Condoleezza Rice was a talented classical musician before she started studying politics.
Rather, you can develop passion by doing work that you find enjoyable and meaningful. The key is to get good at something that helps other people.

## Where we go wrong
The usual way people try to work out their dream job is to *imagine* different jobs and think about how satisfying they seem. Or they think about times they’ve felt fulfilled in the past and self-reflect about what matters most to them.
@img-dsc(https://cdn.80000hours.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/xkcd-dream-job.png, `<a href="https://xkcd.com/1346/" target="_blank"><center>xkcd</center></a>`)
If this were a normal career guide, we’d start by getting you to write out a list of what you most want from a job, like “working outdoors” and “working with ambitious people”. The best-selling career advice book of all time, *What Color is Your Parachute*, recommends exactly this. The hope is that, deep down, people know what they really want.
However, research shows that although self-reflection is useful, it only goes so far.
You can probably think of times in your own life when you were excited about a holiday or party, but when it actually happened, it was just okay. In the last few decades, research has shown that this is common: we’re bad at predicting what will make us most happy, and we don’t even realise how bad we are. You can find an excellent overview of this research in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427" target="_blank">*Stumbling on Happiness*</a>, by Harvard Professor Dan Gilbert.[^:`There has been an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affective_forecasting">extensive programme</a> of research into how good humans are at predicting the effects of future events on their emotional well-being. It began with Kahneman and Snell in the early 1990s, and has recently been led by Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert. Much of the research is summarised in Gilbert’s book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427">Stumbling on Happiness</a>. A recent review is in <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170403154011/https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3110936/Gilbert_WhyBrainTalksItself.pdf?sequence=1">Gilbert and Wilson (2009)</a>. The main takeaway is that we are bad at predicting how we will feel in the future, and we don’t realise this. We’ve previously written about our failures to predict how we will feel <a href="/2012/09/do-you-really-know-what-job-will-make-you-happy/">here</a>.`]
It turns out we’re even bad at *remembering* how satisfying different experiences were. One well-established mistake is that we tend to judge an experience mainly by its ending. If you missed your flight on the last day of an enjoyable holiday, you’ll probably remember the holiday as bad. This means we can’t just trust our intuitions; we need a more systematic way of working out which job is best for us.
|The fact that we often judge the pleasure of an experience by its ending can cause us to make some curious choices.
|– Prof. Dan Gilbert, Stumbling on Happiness
The same research that proves how bad we are at self-reflection can help us make more informed choices. We now have two decades of research into positive psychology – the science of happiness – as well as decades of research into motivation and job satisfaction. We’ll summarise the main lessons of this research and explain what it means for finding a fulfilling job.
## Two overrated goals for a fulfilling career
People often imagine that a dream job is well paid and easy.
One of the leading job rankings in the US, provided by Careercast, rates jobs on the following criteria:[^:`CareerCast’s 2015 methodology is described <a href="http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2015-jobs-rated-methodology">here</a>. <br> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302120256/http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/2015-jobs-rated-methodology">Archived link</a>, retrieved 2-March-2016`]
1. Is it highly paid?
1. Is it going to be highly paid in the future?
1. Is it stressful?
1. Is the working environment unpleasant?
Based on this, the best job in 2015 was: actuary.[^:`<a href="http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2015">Actuary was the top ranked career in 2015.</a> <br> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160302120647/http://www.careercast.com/jobs-rated/best-jobs-2015">Archived link</a>, retrieved 2-Mar-2016.`] That is, someone who uses statistics to measure and manage risks, often in the insurance industry.
It’s true that actuaries are more satisfied with their jobs than average, but they’re not among the most satisfied.[^:`A national survey by the UK’s Cabinet Office in 2014 (published by the University of Kent) found actuaries ranked 64th out of 274 job titles, putting them in the top 23%. <br> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">BBC summary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416020107/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">Archived link</a>, retrieved 15-April-2017. <br> <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm">http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm</a>`] Only 36% say their work is meaningful,[^:`A national survey by the UK’s Cabinet Office in 2014 (published by the University of Kent) found actuaries ranked 64th out of 274 job titles, putting them in the top 23%. <br> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">BBC summary</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170416020107/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-26671221">Archived link</a>, retrieved 15-April-2017. <br> <a href="http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm">http://www.kent.ac.uk/careers/Choosing/happiest-careers.htm</a>`] so being an actuary isn’t a particularly fulfilling career.
So the *Careercast* list isn’t capturing everything. In fact, the evidence suggests that money and avoiding stress aren’t that important.
